[The dataset](<https://conference-board.org/data/economydatabase/total-economy-database-productivity)> is from the Total Economy Databaseâ„¢, which was developed by the Groningen Growth and Development Centre at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. It compiles annual time series data from 131 countries from 1950 to 2021. The dataset measures GDP, population, employment, hours, labor quality, capital services, labor productivity (output per labor hour), and Total Factor Productivity (measures how much output can be produced from a certain amount of labor and capital inputs). The dataset is a combination of the world economy productivity data set, which was created by Dale Jorgenson and Khuong Vu of Harvard University, and the Total Economy Growth Accounting Database, which was created by the Groningen Growth and Development Centre.
